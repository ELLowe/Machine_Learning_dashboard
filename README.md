This project tests the efficacy of a variety of machine learning methods to try and quantify the risk of two different anxiety disorders in young children. The goal was to maximize our ability to predict Generalized Anxiety Disorder(GAD), Seperation Anxiety Disorder(SAD), or both. The ML methods tested were decision trees, KNN, logistic regression and neural networks. Each method was used to test for GAD independently, SAD independently, both at the same time, and a binary of the presence or absence of any anxiety disorder. We found less success trying to predict both GAD and SAD at the same time but predicting one at a time proved more fruitful: we were able to predict GAD with 84.7% accuracy using KNN and SAD with 84.72% accuracy using decision trees. While these results certainly don't stand alone as predictors of anxiety disorders, they could be developed into a screening tool before seeking further help.
